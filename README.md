# Home_Sales
* Module 22 Challenge *
## Project Overview
Using SparkSQL to analyze key metrics about home sales data, I examined the following questions:

> What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year?

> What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

> What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

> What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query, and round off your answer to two decimal places.
